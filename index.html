                <p>Hello there! I am Thomas Zhou, a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
                <p>As a leader of the robotics team and the string orchestra, I have ample experience working with others in a team environment as well as being a role model for others. From these leadership positions, I have been able to improve and hone my communication skills from interactions with the members of the club, as well as teacher supervisors.</p>
                <p>As a leader of the build and design in my school’s FIRST robotics team, I am one of the first people new members look to when looking for clarification or help at any task at hand. In the string orchestra, the conductor turns to me regarding the information on soloists and stylistic details of the music we are playing. Being in a leadership role has taught me the importance of organization and collaboration, especially in a team environment. As a graduate of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, I have developed strong organizational skills and work ethic. The rigorous curriculum of the IB alongside numerous mandatory IB assignments and projects has trained me to effectively manage time to complete tasks. The fast-paced curriculum has also trained my ability to quickly learn and develop my skills.</p>
                <p>Not only am I involved in school, but I am also involved in many community organizations and events. For over six years, I have been a volunteer at the Durham Chinese Culture Center’s soccer club. I was responsible for leading 20 kids in soccer drills and refereeing games. I have also volunteered at Fairview Library to teach children how to build and program NXT Lego Robotics. Working as a volunteer has given me invaluable experience working with different types of people as well as how to communicate effectively with them.</p>
